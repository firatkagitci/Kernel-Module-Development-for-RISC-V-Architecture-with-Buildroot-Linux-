The repository is organized with comprehensive Markdown files explaining each step to perform the project. Following the given order, the source files are presented separately in the source folder. 

This repository is prepared to explain how to create the development environment in our case Buildroot-Linux running with QEMU emulating RISC-V architecture, and an implementation of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm integrated into a kernel module. We developed a driver code on our Ubuntu host machine and used cross-compilation which is a toolchain you add to your host to translate the driver code you developed on your Ubuntu host to the target Buildroot-Linux as a kernel module. Buildroot is a simple, efficient tool for generating embedded Linux systems through cross-compilation. It's ideal for developing lightweight Linux versions for resource-constrained embedded devices. Keep in mind we do not create the kernel module on target Buildroot since it does not provide compilation tools due to its lightweight nature.

As a prerequisite, the person who reads this repository should be familiar with operating systems fundamentals and especially the basic theory of kernel modules.

This project is done on a Ubuntu host (version 23.10) and in our case running on a virtual machine created on the Virtual Box software, by Oracle. For instructions on setting this environment visit ubuntu.com and virtualbox.org. The commands here are compatible with Ubuntu/Debian distributions.
